This is a collection of the configuration files and custom scripts that I use for various things on my main machine (Dell XPS 15 9560 laptop running Arch Linux).  If you want to use something that's alright, but note that a lot of files have paths specific to my system setup so you'll have to go through and modify them accordingly.
